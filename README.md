# AI Certs Event Landing Page

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Review the Design Mockup

1. **Access the Figma Design Brief:**
   - Review the design elements, layout, color schemes, typography, and branding guidelines provided in the Figma prototype.
   - Note down the key components that need to be included on the landing page such as headers, banners, event schedule, speaker bios, and call-to-action buttons.

### Step 2: Create a High-Fidelity Mockup

1. **Set Up Design Tools:**
   - Use Adobe XD, Sketch, or Figma to create a high-fidelity mockup based on the wireframes and design brief.
   - Ensure the design aligns with AI Certs' branding guidelines, incorporating their color palette, fonts, and logo.

2. **Design the Layout:**
   - **Header**: Include the event name, date, and a navigation menu.
   - **Banner Section**: Feature a prominent banner with a catchy headline and a call-to-action button.
   - **Event Details**: Design sections for the event schedule, speaker bios, and registration information.
   - **Footer**: Include contact information, social media links, and any additional resources.

3. **Make the Mockup Responsive:**
   - Design for desktop, tablet, and mobile views to ensure responsiveness.
   - Pay attention to how elements stack and adjust on smaller screens.

### Step 3: Convert the Mockup into HTML/CSS

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
   - Create a new project folder and initialize it with the necessary files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `scripts.js`.

2. **HTML Structure:**
   - Write the HTML structure starting from the doctype declaration to the closing `</html>` tag.
   - Divide the content into semantic sections using HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.

3. **CSS Styling:**
   - Write the CSS to style the page, ensuring it matches the high-fidelity mockup.
   - Use media queries to make the layout responsive for different devices.

### Step 4: Implement Basic Interactivity

1. **Add a Countdown Timer:**
   - Use JavaScript to implement a dynamic countdown timer for the event.

2. **Collapsible Schedule:**
   - Implement collapsible sections for the event schedule using jQuery.

### Step 5: Testing and Validation

1. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
   - Test the landing page on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure compatibility.

2. **W3C Validation:**
   - Validate the HTML and CSS using W3C validation tools to ensure code quality and standards compliance.

### Step 6: Deliverables

1. **Design Mockup Files:**
   - Save and share the high-fidelity mockup files showcasing the design for different screen sizes.

2. **Source Code:**
   - Provide the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files used in the project.

3. **Live Page Link:**
   - Deploy the landing page using a hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. Provide the link to the live, hosted version of the page.

4. **Development Report:**
   - Document the development process, challenges faced, and solutions implemented in a concise report.
